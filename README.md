# Aderemi "Gray" Ademola

**AI Engineer • AI Architect • Software Engineer**

I design intelligent systems that solve real problems — from language interfaces and fashion-tech to agent-based tools and audio analysis. My focus is building AI-native products that feel natural, fast, and useful.

## What I'm Focused On

Right now, I'm deep into building **agentic and intelligent systems** — tools that reason, retrieve, and respond. My priorities include:

- Creating **agent frameworks** with memory, personality, and workflow logic (Tavari)
- Building **AI-first applications** where intelligence is baked into the UI/UX
- Merging **natural language + structured logic** to solve real user problems
- Exploring **vector databases**, **multi-agent collaboration**, and **RAG pipelines**
- Pushing fast from idea → architecture → usable product

## Dev Habits & Philosophy

- I build with **clean architecture**, even in experiments
- I learn by doing — no fluff, just iterations
- I design systems that are meant to scale, not just demo
- I treat AI like a product, not just an API
- If it's not useful to someone, it's not done
